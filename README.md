# Dewatermarking for LLM-Generated Text

A Python project for studying and removing watermarks from AI-generated text. This project provides tools and methods to analyze, detect, and potentially remove watermarks that are embedded in text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and manipulation of watermarking techniques used in LLM-generated text. It includes components for:
- Detecting watermarks in text using various detection methods
- Evaluating watermark strength and effectiveness
- Implementing text rephrasing strategies to study watermark robustness
- Generating watermarked text for experimental purposes
